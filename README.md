## Introduction

Power outages pose significant risks to the safety, economy, and daily life of U.S. citizens, making it imperative to understand the factors that influence their duration and impact. Our  analysis utilizes a dataset on major power outage events in the continental U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016, provided by Mukherjee, Nateghi, and Hastak from Purdue University. The dataset includes information on geographical location, regional climatic conditions, land-use characteristics, regional electricity consumption patterns, and economic attributes of power outages in various states. Given such a holistic understanding of power outages, we posed the question that could support energy companies when considering where to aid during power outages. Our key question is: What are the key factors that influence the durations of major power outages in the continental U.S., and how can these insights be used to mitigate future outages? This question holds practical implications for utility companies, as well as regional communities. By identifying the determinants of outage durations, energy companies  can better prepare for and respond to future incidents. Given the increasing number and high severity of weather-related disruptions, understanding these dynamics, in correlation to power outages, is more critical than ever. The dataset used in this project has 1534 rows and 56 columns, and offers comprehensive insight to uncover our questions through data analysis. The dataset encompasses information on every major power outage in the United States from 2000 to 2016. Only a handful of columns were used for analysis and prediction, as described below:


| Feature        | Description     |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| `YEAR`       | the year when the outage event occurred
 | 
| out of stock | good and plenty   | 
| ok           | good     | 
| ok           | good `zoute` drop |
